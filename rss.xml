</p>

<h3>Transcript:P02 Pronunciation Drills Video</h3>
<p>
What’s going on with these pronunciation videos? I said before that I’d do these regularly, using some sentences from the pronunciation drills from previous premium episodes.
</p><p>
I’ve done P01, now it’s time for P02 and I’ll keep adding these videos until I’ve caught up with the audio episodes, then I’ll be doing more videos for each new premium episode series as they are published. So that’s why you’re getting a video for episode 2 when I’m actually now publishing series 16, 17 and so on.
</p><p>
P02 Pronunciation Drills - from premium episode 2, which was my conversation with Raphael Miller from Liverpool.
</p><p>
I’ve chosen these sentences because they’re not too long, contain things like phrasal verbs and other common bits of usage.
</p><p>
Also, having read out the sentences a few times I can tell they have a certain rhythm to them.
</p><p>
Look out for</p>
<ul>
	<li>Which words are stressed</li>
	<li>How little words are pronounced with weak forms</li>
	<li>How words are connected together</li>
	<li>Listen to the pronunciation parts of recent premium episodes to find out more about word linking and weak forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, try to say these without any pauses, unless a pause is necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried turning it off and on again?</li>
<li>You don’t want to come across as fake</li>
<li>You’re setting up your own summer school</li>
<li>It gives them a chance to broaden their horizons a bit.</li>
<li>We don’t want students to be sitting around for hours.</li>
<li>Everyone’s in the same boat so you end up making friends</li>
<li>We’d always have a chat whenever we bumped into each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2>P03 Pronunciation Drills Video</h2>
<date>Oct 28, 2019</date>

<p> video featuring pronunciation drills taken from Premium episode 03.</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>
Includes sample sentences from the pronunciation drills in premium episode 3, which was about the royal wedding with my mum (I mean my mum was in the episode, not in the wedding).
</p><p>
As usual, listen for which words are stressed in the sentence (usually the main ‘meaning’ words) and how that affects the rest of the sentence, especially how other little words are pronounced using weak forms and how words are connected together in various ways.
</p><p>
Usually, auxiliary verbs in sentences are pronounced with weak forms, except in certain cases, like when they are at the end of the sentence, as you will hear in a couple of these examples.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>It was such a lovely day and her dress was so beautiful.</li>
	<li>The more I watched it, the more fascinated I became.</li>
	<li>A few years ago, I think I would have described myself as a republican. </li>
	<li>It was noticeable how nervous he was. (the first ‘was’ is weak, the 2nd isn’t - because it’s at the end of the sentence)</li>
	<li>She could have been acting the whole thing. But I don’t think she was.</li>
	<li>Harry really seems to be taking it all in.</li>
	<li>He must have been thinking about her</li>
	<li>Can you imagine how tedious it must be?</li>

<h2>P04 Pronunciation Drills Video</h2>
<date>Dec 6, 2019</date>
<p>Pronunciation drills for premium episode 04, including target language from LEP#529 "The M Word" with Andy Johnson.</p>

<h3>Episode Script and Drills</h3>
<p>
Hello premium people and welcome to the pronunciation drills video for P04. This is the 4th short pronunciation video that I’ve done for you and it features pronunciation exercises using target language from episode 529 of Luke’s English Podcast (The M Word). Do you remember that episode? I chatted to friend of the podcast Andy Johnson about things like running marathons, giving talks about millennials and how he looks like Moby.
</p><p>
So there was episode 529, which was a conversation.
</p><p>
Premium episode 04 in which I broke down a lot of the language from the conversation.
</p><p>
And this video contains pronunciation drills featuring a selection of that vocabulary.
</p><p>
If you’re not sure what some of the language means, you’ll have to go back to P04 and review it, either by listening or by checking the PDF.
</p><p>
In these drills we’re going to focus on all the usual things like sentence stress, connected speech and intonation. You just have to try and repeat them like me. You can see the sentences written on the screen. You should also try to repeat the sentences without reading them because it’s good training for your ears. So, consider using your finger or a  piece of paper to just cover the sentences sometimes as you repeat. It’s good to practise repeating what you hear and then check the sentences to make sure you’re doing them properly. The sentences are also provided in the show notes.
</p><p>
Right, let’s go.</p>
<ol>
	<li>I narrowly missed out on winning by just under 3 hours. </li>
	<li>This would have been Wednesday afternoon.</li>
	<li>As I was running down to meet him, I felt my calf muscle pop.</li>
	<li>You must have been gutted. </li>
	<li>We did a 90-minute run.</li>
	<li>I kept needing to stop to go to the toilet!</li>
	<li>I ran past a guy dressed as Jesus. </li>
	<li>There was a guy dressed as a toilet.</li>
</ol>

<h2>P05 Pronunciation Drills Video</h2>
<date>Dec 7, 2019</date>
<p>Here are some pronunciation drills from P05 which was about language from 540 of LEP. That one was a ramble from me about things like the world cup, old computer games, getting music stuck in your head and more.</p>
<p>
Just try to say the sentences like me. Copy my word stress, sentence stress, connected speech and other pronunciation features.
</p>

<h3>Listen and repeat.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Pause the video in order to repeat after me.</li>
<li>Check P05 again if you’re not sure of any vocab.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pronunciation Drills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>This might be a trip down memory lane for some of you.</li>
	<li>If there are any new people listening to this - jump on board and get involved.</li>
	<li>They’re made of tough stuff (the Croatian team).</li>
	<li>I’ve got a song running around my head and I can’t shift it.</li>
	<li>They were very catchy tunes indeed.</li>
	<li>Sonic the Hedgehog was popular – but he couldn’t hold a candle to Mario and all the Mario games.</li>

<h2>P06 Pronunciation Drills Video</h2>
<date>Jun 23, 2020</date>

<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>In this pronunciation drills video I’m going to do some pronunciation drills using language from Premium 06 focusing specifically on the section about verb forms. In P06 I dealt with vocab that came up in episodes I did about how I record episodes of the podcast. In this set of drills I’m focusing on the sentences containing verb phrases, especially from part 1 of the series.</p>
<p>
Just try to repeat after me. Cover the screen there to avoid reading what you’re hearing. But use the notes to help you notice where the sentence stress is, and other details.
</p><p>
In terms of target language, it’s all about verb phrases, like these
</p>
<ol>
	<li>To go through something</li>
	<li>To build something up from scratch</li>
	<li>To build something up bit by bit</li>
	<li>To go straight over someone’s head</li>
	<li>To feel your way through</li>
	<li>To work it out as you go along</li>
	<li>To come up with ideas</li>
	<li>To turn them into content</li>
<li>To write something down</li>
<li>To break something down</li>
<li>To set out to achieve something</li>
<li>To dig deeper</li>
<li>To lose track of time</li>
<li>That’s 13 items of target language in 10 drills. To remember them all, go back to Premium series 6 and you can listen again to properly remember the context of these phrases and specifically what they mean.</li>
</ol>
<p>
For now, let’s look at how to say them in full sentences.
</p><p>
Focus on word stress in the sentence. The rest should fall into place when you get that right.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>You’ll hear me going through all that language piece by piece.</li>
	<li>I built this business up from scratch.</li>
	<li>A lot of my advice just went straight over her head. </li>
	<li>I’m just feeling my way through the process and working it out as I go along.</li>
	<li>I’m going to talk about how to come up with ideas and then turn them into actual content. </li>
	<li>I have to write it all down or I won’t remember it. </li>
	<li>Let me break this down for you and make it simple. </li>
	<li>I can’t say I always achieve what I set out to achieve</li>
	<li>Always dig a little bit deeper.</li>
	<li>Sorry I must have lost track of time.</li>
</ol>

<h2>P07 Pronunciation Drills Video</h2>
<date>Jun 24,2020</date>
<h3>Transcript</h3>

This is a pronunciation drills video for P07 The Grammar of Gandalf.

In this one we’re focusing on pronunciation for different verb tenses.

If you remember, in series 07 I took a clip from the film version of Lord of the Rings and broke it down for grammar, covering a lot of verb tenses in the process.

So this episode is going to deal with pronunciation drills across various verb tenses and for that reason it’s going to be really useful for you.

Pay particular attention to the way auxiliary verbs are pronounced with weak forms and how words join together in connected speech.

<title>P08 Pronunciation Drills Video - FACIAL EXPRESSIONS & BODY LANGUAGE</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<h2>P08 Pronunciation Drills Video - FACIAL EXPRESSIONS & BODY LANGUAGE</h2>
<date>Jun 25,2020</date>
<p>Hello, this is a pronunciation drills video for Premium series 8. This is a slightly longer one than usual, but it should be a good one.</p>
<p>
I thought it would be funny and useful to record a video of myself saying the phrases from Premium episode 8 because body language and facial expressions are important. You don’t just say things with your mouth. You say them with your whole body.
</p>
For example,<strong>Check out this dialogue with no body language. </strong>
<ul>
	<li>A: Hey, I’ve got to tell you something. I’ve met this girl and we’ve fallen completely in love with each other. She actually makes me happy. You know what, I never realised I could be this happy. We’re going to get married and everything. This is fantastic! I’m absolutely delighted!
</li>
<li>B: Wow, yeah, I bet you are mate, that’s amazing. Good for you. Nice one. Really happy for you mate!</li>
</ul>
<p>
OK, so with that kind of thing in mind, let’s go through the phrases from this series again. This time, you can see my body language. So think about my facial expressions, my attitude, the way I use my hands, the way I move my body.
</p><p>
I’m exaggerating a bit, for comic effect, but it’s a really good exercise for you to try to copy me too. See if you can say these phrases with attitude.
</p>
<p>These are actually the phrases from the test in part 5 by the way.</p>

<h3>Some Phrases from Parts 1 & 3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>🗯Ooh, there’s snow and ice outside and the thermometer says -15 degrees. I’d say it’s probably coat-wearing weather,➡️ Yeah, no shit sherlock!</li>
	<li>🗯Imagine, you’re playing a game of cards and suddenly your friend gets serious and starts using some more competitive tactics. He’s suddenly become more ruthless. You notice the way his strategy has become more serious, so you say:➡️ Oh I see, (it’s) like that is it? We’re playing that kind of game, are we?</li>
	<li>🗯Your friend says, “Hey you’d better put your thick coat on, it’s absolutely freezing outside!” Then you get outside and it’s not as cold as you expected. ➡️ Come on, it’s not that cold.</li>
	<li>🗯You change out of your wet clothes into some warm pajamas and slippers. What do you say?➡️ Ahhhh, that’s more like it!</li>
	<li>🗯Your friend says, “So my boyfriend has promised that he’s going to stop drinking forever.” You don’t believe he will, and you think… ➡️ Yeah, that’ll be the day</li>
	<li>Someone you know says, "Hey your English pronunciation is terrible! Ha ha ha!" (He pronounced the word “pronunciation” wrong.)➡️ You can talk.</li>
	<li>🗯You’re a idiot.➡️ Well it takes one to know one!</li>
	<li>🗯So the guys from Orange say our internet won’t be connected until next week.➡️ Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me!</li>
	<li>🗯You’ve taken your kids to school and you want them to leave the car and enter the school➡️ Right, off you go then! See you later. Have a good day!</li>
	<li>🗯You see your friend who you haven’t seen for a while. You want to say “So, how are you?” and you want to know about his/her recent activities. You’d like to catch up, basically.➡️ So, what have you been up to?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phrases from Parts 2 & 4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>🗯You’re a teacher and you expect that your students haven’t done their homework again. You’re talking to your colleague. ➡️ I bet they haven’t done their homework again.</li>
	<li>🗯You ask your friend, “So, how was the kids’ party?” and she says"I tell you what, it was great but they were mental! 20 kids running around our house all day. I’m absolutely exhausted"➡️ Yeah, I bet you are!</li>
	<li>🗯Two friends are having a chat, and suddenly one of them makes a rude and suggestive innuendo (a suggestive joke)</li>
	<li>Person A: “Imagine living in the past when everyone rode around on horses.” Person B: “Sounds quite nice to me”</li>
	<li>Person A: “What, even the horses? It would be annoying, wouldn’t it?”</li>
	<li>Person B: “Ooh I don’t know, I’d quite like to have a hot muscular beast between my legs every day!”</li>
	<li>➡️ Oooh, I bet you would! Ha ha ha ha ha ha etc (immature giggling)</li>
	<li>🗯Shall we have lunch in the usual place?➡️ Yeah, we might as well.</li>
	<li>🗯So, Brexit has been called off. It’s not going to happen. A lot of people are pissed off about it, but on balance...➡️ ...It’s probably for the best.</li>
	<li>🗯Imagine, you’re in the pub with a friend who is in an excited and slightly crazy mood. He says “Hey, let’s get the beers in, and we’ll get shots too! Double shots for everyone!! Triple shots!!! Quadruple shots!!! Quint… five shots for everyone!!”➡️ Alright, steady on! Easy tiger! Woah there!</li>
	<li>🗯You’re climbing on a chair to fix a lightbulb and my Mum is in the room. She’s suddenly worried that you’ll have an accident. What does she say?➡️ Careful! (specific pronunciation)</li>
	<li>8. 🗯So you failed your driving test again. How do you feel?➡️ I’m absolutely gutted mate.</li>
</ul>

<title>P09 Pronunciation Drills Video</title>

<h2>P09 Pronunciation Drills Video</h2>
<date>Jun 26, 2020
</date>
<p><h3>Transcrip</h3></p>

<p>
Welcome to the pronunciation drills video for P09 which was all about language from the first Alan Partridge series I did (LEP 547-549).
</p><p>
These pronunciation drills videos are here to give you some extra practice with pronunciation, while also being able to watch me, watch my body language and the way my mouth moves.

</p><p>
As usual I do ask that you repeat after me. These videos are all part of a process of language practice to help you not just understand some target language but use it too.

</p><p>
Just repeat the sentences after me several times. Try to find the stressed words in the sentence. Watch out for weak forms of prepositions and auxiliary verbs and also the way words blend into each other with connected speech.

</p><p>
Honestly, this is how I understand you can improve your pronunciation and speaking, so I really hope you repeat after me rather than just watching me say some sentences.

</p><p>
You might want to check P09 again or possibly LEP 547-549 to hear all this language explained, demonstrated and presented in its original context.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>It requires really good English to be able to read between the lines and pick up on very slight verbal and non-verbal clues.</li>
	<li>Alan’s career is going badly. He’s drifted into obscurity. </li>
	<li>You go through a bad patch and you can smile at the end of it, probably.</li>
	<li>I didn’t say I was going through a bad patch, I said I was at a loose end. </li>
	<li>You both sound exhausted, have you been running?</li>
	<li>Do you fancy a breath of fresh air?</li>
	<li>I got caught in a taxi that broke down.</li>
	<li>I’d rather have a few superficial bruises than a massively lacerated face. </li>
	<li>I’d love to feel an airbag go off in my face.</li>
	<li>Come on Lynn, I’ll drop you at a cab rank.</li>
</ol>

<h2>P10 Pronunciation Drills Video</h2>
<date>Jun 27,2020</date>
<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>
Welcome to the pronunciation drills video for P10 which was the language analysis, test and pronunciation practice for language which came up in my conversation with Zdenek Lukas. Here you’ll listen to and repeat phrases and sentences said by both of us.
</p><p>
The emphasis is on clear but fluent speech. As usual I recommend that you listen out for the sentence stress. There’s a lot of stress involved in learning English, isn’t there?
</p><p>
<p>
Sentence stress will guide you for other things like weak forms and connected speech so pay attention to that first.

	<li>It can be a real pain in the neck, writing a masters degree.</li>

<h4>
Transcript
</h4>
Hello! Welcome to Premium Pronunciation Video number 11. In this one we’re going to practise saying 10 sentences that came up in Premium Episode 11, which was the analysis of language which came in the podcast episode I did about Paul Chowdhry.
</p><p>
That was a really full series of episodes absolutely jam packed with target language.
</p><p>

As usual with these pronunciation videos, I’ve only taken a small selection of that target language for these drills. If you want all of it, including explanations and the rest, go back to P11 and listen to all of that. These drills come from the memory test & pron drills in the original series.
</p><p>

Focus on sentence stress, as usual. The rest should fall into place after that.


<ul>
	<li>It’s boiling in here! I am absolutely boiling in this jacket! </li>
	<li>I was absolutely roasting in bed last night. I’m not used to sleeping with the window closed.</li>
	<li>We’re moving next month so we’re trying to get rid of as much of our stuff as possible. </li>
<li>My wife and I first moved in together when I moved out of my flat in London and moved to Paris.</li>
<li>I reckon it’ll probably be cold outside today so you ought to bring a coat.</li>
<li>Could you put on a slight American accent for this job?</li>
<li>This cake is lovely. How did you make it so moist?</li>
<li>Sorry I had a bad day and I was just taking it out on you.</li>
<li>These towels still aren’t dry. They’re still a bit damp.</li>
<li>I’ve got (a bit of) a bad stomach</li>
